Work in this thesis is based on assumption that we already have good sketches. First this thesis must express
motivation what are sketches, why are sketchces important and what is good sketch according to DISA research.

Then we need to explain that in order for sketches to serve their purpose it's needed to find a good indexing approach
to speed up in-memory lookups. We should also mention that we only consider Hamming distance for reasons of HW implementation.

One promising approach for such task is Multi-Index hashing. We need to evaluate this approach and measure some metrics
against sequential scan. Metrics could be numbers of hamming distance computation and time of search in different scenarios.
Experiments should also evaluate performance of method based on selected substring size m and range r.
